# Zen42 â€” A somewhat sane keymap for the Corne-ish Zen V2

![Corne-ish Zen Logo](img/Zen_R3_sticker.png)

This repository contains my personal keymap configuration for the Corne-ish Zen V2 low profile wireless mechanical keyboard. It's based on the official configuration but customized to suit my specific needs and preferences.

## Keymap Overview

The keymap is designed with multiple layers to provide easy access to a wide range of functions while maintaining a compact 42-key layout. Here's a brief overview of the layers:

1. **Base Layer**: Standard QWERTY layout with some modifications for improved ergonomics and efficiency.
2. **F-Numbers Layer**: Function keys and numpad layout.
3. **Symbols Layer**: Easy access to symbols and special characters.
4. **Navigation Layer**: Arrow keys, page navigation, and media controls.
5. **Board Layer**: Bluetooth controls and additional function keys.

### Key Features

- **Consistent Modifiers**: All modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt, GUI) are accessible from every layer, ensuring consistent keyboard behavior across layers.
- **Custom Modifiers**: The base layer includes custom modifiers like `mt RALT DELETE` for the top-right key, combining Alt and Delete functions.
- **Layer Switching**: Utilizes the `lt` (layer-tap) function for easy layer switching, e.g., `lt 3 SPACE` for accessing the navigation layer.
- **Bluetooth Functionality**: The board layer includes Bluetooth clear, previous, and next functions for easy device switching.
- **Conditional Layers**: Implements a conditional layer that activates the board layer when both layer 2 and 1 are active.
